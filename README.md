# ECE3 Final Project - Line Following TI-RSLK Car

Line following program was writted in arduino. It allows the car to follow a black line over a track. The project requirements were to complete the full track under 90 seconds while following the line. 

The track was composed of multiple elements such as: loops, sharp turns, and a 180Â° turn. The car uses PD control (the integral term of PID was left out).

The working code of the assignment is in `./main/main.ino`.
